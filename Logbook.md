# Day 1

Today, I completed the first challenge of The London App Brewery's 100 Days of Code Challenge. It was all about using input and combining strings into one and then printing them out. For this task, I created a Band Name Generator that takes two inputs: the name of the city you were born in and the name of your pet. It then combines these two inputs to create a unique band name.

For example, if the city is "Miami" and the pet's name is "Bunny," the generated band name would be "Miami Bunny."

Here's a code sample to illustrate how I used the `input()` function to collect user data in Python:

```python
city = input("Enter the name of the city you were born in: ")
pet_name = input("Enter the name of your pet: ")

# Combine the inputs to create a band name
band_name = city + " " + pet_name

# Print the generated band name
print(f"Your band name is: {band_name}")
```
You can check out the code I used for Day 1 on [GitHub: Band name generator](https://github.com/JelleWierenga/the-London-App-Brewery/tree/main/Band%20name%20generator).


This code sample demonstrates how to use the `input()` function to collect user input and then combine the provided values to generate a band name.
